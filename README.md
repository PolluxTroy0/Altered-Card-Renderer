# Altered Card Renderer

In Altered TCG, each Unique card is one-of-a-kind: its artwork and stats are specific to a single physical card owned by a player. This renderer lets you **display the full card image** of any Unique — artwork, frame, biome values, effect text — by fetching its data from an API and drawing it into an HTML canvas.

Embed it on any page with a single `<script>` tag.  
No build step, no framework, no dependencies.

## Embed anywhere — one tag

The simplest way to display cards on any page. Drop the `<script>` tag, then use `<altered-card>` wherever you want — in articles, CMS templates, static pages, anywhere.

**Via jsDelivr (no hosting required):**

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/PolluxTroy0/Altered-Card-Renderer@main/altered-card-renderer.js"></script>

<altered-card ref="ALT_CORE_B_AX_04_U_10"></altered-card>
<altered-card ref="ALT_EOLE_B_OR_109_U_374" locale="en"></altered-card>
```

**Self-hosted:**

```html
<script src="https://your-domain.com/path/to/altered-card-renderer.js"></script>

<altered-card ref="ALT_CORE_B_AX_04_U_10"></altered-card>
<altered-card ref="ALT_EOLE_B_OR_109_U_374" locale="en"></altered-card>
```

By default the renderer automatically looks for `altered-card-renderer-proxy.php` in the same folder as `altered-card-renderer.js`, and loads card configs from `https://altered-db.com/forge/`. No attributes needed for a standard setup.

**Attributes on `<altered-card>`:**

| Attribute | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `ref` | — | Card reference (required) |
| `locale` | `en` | Language (`en`, `fr`, `es`, `it`, `de`) |
| `collection` | `official` | Frame collection (`official` or `community`) |

---

## Configuration

### In `altered-card-renderer.js`

The `RESOURCES` object at the top of the file centralises all configurable paths and URLs:

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `configBaseUrl` | `https://altered-db.com/forge/` | Root URL for card config files (positions, frames, fonts…). See note below. |
| `cardApiUrl` | `https://altered-core-cards-api.toxicity.be/…` | Card data API. `{ref}` and `{locale}` are substituted at runtime. |
| `proxyUrl` | `null` | Proxy mode: `null` = auto-detect (`altered-card-renderer-proxy.php` next to the script), `false` = no proxy (API called directly, requires CORS), `"https://…"` = explicit URL. |
| `configIndex` | `config/index.json` | Path to the config index (relative to `configBaseUrl`). |
| `alteredIconsCss` | `alteredicons.css` | Path to the Altered icon font (relative to `configBaseUrl`). |
| `qrcodeLib` | `assets/vendor/qrcodejs/qrcode.min.js` | Path to QRCode.js (relative to `configBaseUrl`, or absolute URL). |
| `useApiBackground` | `true` | `true` = use the image URL returned by the API. `false` = use a custom URL template (see `backgroundUrl`). |
| `backgroundUrl` | `""` | URL template used when `useApiBackground` is `false`. Variables: `{ref}`, `{locale}`, `{faction}` (AX, BR…), `{rarity}` (C, R, U, E), `{set}` (CORE, EOLE…), `{id}`. Browse available images at [img.altered-db.com](https://img.altered-db.com). |
| `backgroundUrlIdTransform` | `null` | Optional regex transforms applied to `{id}` before URL substitution. Array of `[regexPattern, replacement]` pairs applied in order. Used when the asset filenames differ from the card reference. Example: `[["_U_\\d+$", "_U"]]` strips the collector number from unique cards (`ALT_CORE_B_AX_07_U_1698` → `ALT_CORE_B_AX_07_U`). Set to `null` to disable. |

> **Note — `configBaseUrl`:** The default value points to `https://altered-db.com/forge/`, which hosts all the card config files and assets: element positions, frame images, fonts, biome images, set logos, and more. This is **temporary** — the config and assets will be published to the GitHub repository once all card settings are finalised. Until then, the renderer relies on altered-db.com as the config source.

### In `altered-card-renderer-proxy.php`

Two variables at the top of the file:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `$CORS_ORIGIN` | `*` | `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header value. Restrict to a specific domain if needed. |
| `$ALLOWED_IMG_DOMAINS` | `['altered-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com', 'altered-db.com']` | Whitelist of domains the image proxy may fetch from (SSRF protection). Add any CDN or S3 host that serves card images. |
| `$ALLOWED_API_DOMAINS` | `['altered-core-cards-api.toxicity.be', 'api.altered.gg']` | Whitelist of domains the card API may be fetched from. The API URL is set in `RESOURCES.cardApiUrl` in the renderer and passed to the proxy — only whitelisted domains are accepted (SSRF protection). |

---

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `altered-card-renderer.js` | The renderer — also registers the `<altered-card>` custom element |
| `altered-card-renderer-proxy.php` | PHP proxy — bypasses CORS for API calls and image fetches |
| `altered-card-renderer-example.html` | Live demo — 6 cards rendered side by side |
| `altered-card-renderer-card.json` | Sample card JSON — shows the expected API response format |
| `altered-card-renderer-readme.html` | **Full documentation** |

## CORS & PHP Proxy

If your page and the card API are on different domains, `altered-card-renderer-proxy.php` (placed alongside `altered-card-renderer.js`) handles both:

```
altered-card-renderer-proxy.php?ref=ALT_CORE_B_AX_04_U_10&locale=fr   → card JSON
altered-card-renderer-proxy.php?img=https://cdn.example.com/card.webp   → proxied image
```

The card API URL comes from `RESOURCES.cardApiUrl` in the renderer — the proxy never has a hardcoded URL. Both image and API domains are validated against whitelists (`$ALLOWED_IMG_DOMAINS`, `$ALLOWED_API_DOMAINS`) to prevent SSRF attacks.

## Contributing frame settings — Editor mode

Card element positions (text placement, font sizes, biome badge coordinates…) need to be tuned individually for each frame type. The **Editor mode** lets community members help with this work directly inside the Forge.

### What it is

Editor mode is a special URL parameter (`?editor`) that unlocks an extra panel in the Forge UI. Once logged in, you can adjust all element positions on any frame type and save your settings to the server. Those settings are then reviewed and discussed — nothing is applied to other users' cards automatically. The maintainer goes through contributions on Discord and decides which values to merge into the main config.

### How to access it

```
https://altered-db.com/forge/?editor
```

A **Login** button appears in the navbar. Enter a username and password:
- If the account doesn't exist yet, it is created automatically.
- If it already exists, the password is checked against the stored hash.

No email required. The session lasts for the current browser tab only — you'll need to log in again after closing the page.

### Workflow

1. Go to `https://altered-db.com/forge/?editor` and log in.
2. Select a **faction** and a **frame type** in the Card & Media section.
3. Use the sliders to adjust element positions, sizes, and values until they match the official layout. Load a reference card image as an overlay (see the Editor section in the panel) to align precisely.
4. Click **Save** in the navbar to submit your settings for that frame type.
5. Join the **[Discord](https://discord.gg/UffYvABQ)** — tag `.polluxtroy` — to share what you worked on and discuss whether the values should be merged.

### What happens after you save

Your settings are stored server-side under your account. They are **not applied to other users' cards automatically**. The maintainer reviews contributions, discusses adjustments if needed, and manually integrates the agreed values into the main config files.
